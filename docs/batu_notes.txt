/*
You can start with:

3 - search and launch executables having as input the AST we talked before. 
You can build just a couple of test AST instantiation for testing purpose.


8 - implement redirections: you will get the redirections as 
a node of the AST, the redirection node will be linked to (from) a command node.
 The command not will have a input and an output field, which if not NULL will
  point to the redirection node, which will contain in the data field the name 
  of the infile or outfile


9 - implement pipes: like pipex. The pipe will be also a node, which will have 
two children (leafs), which will be an array of two nodes: the command before 
the pipe as the first element of the pipe and as a second node the second 
command or a pipe node.


14 - implement the following builtins: …
	◦ echo with option -n
	◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
	◦ pwd with no options
	◦ export with no options
	◦ unset with no options
	◦ env with no options or arguments
	◦ exit with no options
